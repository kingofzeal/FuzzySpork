      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lately, I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing with &lt;a href=&#34;https://letsencrypt.org/&#34;&gt;Lets Encrypt&lt;/a&gt; as a means to encrypt public(ish) web-based services I run on my local server. It&amp;rsquo;s actually remarkable what this non-profit group has accomplished when it comes to SSL - they offer free, automated SSL certificates to anybody who wants them. They even support SAN certificates (those that cover multiple, explicitly-named DNS entries), and starting in January they will offer wildcard certificates. I will tell anybody who is willing to listen, and who is looking to avoid paying paying $50+ for an SSL certificate, about them and encourage everyone to look into their service. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Using Octopus Deploy to deploy multiple projects at once</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We use Octopus Deploy at my workplace to handle all of our releases. The tool is one of the best I&amp;rsquo;ve had the pleasure of dealing with, and the more I interact with it, the more I realize just how powerful, yet flexible, it is. I will gladly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a way of releasing any kind of software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there is always room for improvement. In this case, not necessarily improvement with the software package, but how we use it. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This morning I realized that, as programmers, we frequently make assumptions about the software we write which seem to be reasonable, but aren&amp;rsquo;t completely thought out.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently read &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.freecodecamp.com/my-journey-to-becoming-a-web-developer-from-scratch-without-a-cs-degree-2-years-later-and-what-i-4a7fd2ff5503#.57ujsobff&#34;&gt;this really awesome article&lt;/a&gt; written by a developer who had no formal education or background and his journey to becoming a front-end developer. Having gone through a somewhat similar transformation, I was inspired to also write about my own transition into programming without a traditional programming background. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>On deployments and distribution</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ever since I started programming, I&amp;rsquo;ve been fascinated with what you can do with a codebase - not just the act of programming, but building and deploying it as well. For a programming company, the less time programmers have to work on building or deploying their code, the more productive they can be. The automation of these things can have a huge benefit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A fascinating picture, isn&amp;rsquo;t it? A fuzzy spork. It conjures images that raise far more questions than they answer. What does it mean? What could make a spork fuzzy? Is it safe? Is it supposed to be like that? Is it really a fuzzy spork or is it a sporked fuzzy? Where are the adults?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
