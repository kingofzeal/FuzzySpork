        Lately, I&rsquo;ve been playing with Lets Encrypt as a means to encrypt public(ish) web-based services I run on my local server. It&rsquo;s actually remarkable what this non-profit group has accomplished when it comes to SSL - they offer free, automated SSL certificates to anybody who wants them. They even support SAN certificates (those that cover multiple, explicitly-named DNS entries), and starting in January they will offer wildcard certificates. I will tell anybody who is willing to listen, and who is looking to avoid paying paying $50+ for an SSL certificate, about them and encourage everyone to look into their service.

        We use Octopus Deploy at my workplace to handle all of our releases. The tool is one of the best I&rsquo;ve had the pleasure of dealing with, and the more I interact with it, the more I realize just how powerful, yet flexible, it is. I will gladly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a way of releasing any kind of software.
However, there is always room for improvement.

        This morning I realized that, as programmers, we frequently make assumptions about the software we write which seem to be reasonable, but aren&rsquo;t completely thought out.I have an older (second generation) iPad that I mostly use for playing games and managing a media server I have set up in my house. Occasionally I will use it as a note-taking device, but honestly it can&rsquo;t do much more, and I don&rsquo;t need it to.

        I recently read this really awesome article written by a developer who had no formal education or background and his journey to becoming a front-end developer. Having gone through a somewhat similar transformation, I was inspired to also write about my own transition into programming without a traditional programming background. Who are you anyway? A fair question, and one I&rsquo;m going to avoid almost entirely. Instead, I&rsquo;m going to say that my formal education is in business, specifically accounting, and that my transition into pure development wasn&rsquo;t radical, but a career evolution.

        Ever since I started programming, I&rsquo;ve been fascinated with what you can do with a codebase - not just the act of programming, but building and deploying it as well. For a programming company, the less time programmers have to work on building or deploying their code, the more productive they can be. The automation of these things can have a huge benefit.I&rsquo;m sure many who may be reading this already have something in place to automatically build code, either on check-in, at a specific time, or both.
