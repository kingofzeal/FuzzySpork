      <description>Lately, I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing with Lets Encrypt as a means to encrypt public(ish) web-based services I run on my local server. It&amp;rsquo;s actually remarkable what this non-profit group has accomplished when it comes to SSL - they offer free, automated SSL certificates to anybody who wants them. They even support SAN certificates (those that cover multiple, explicitly-named DNS entries), and starting in January they will offer wildcard certificates. I will tell anybody who is willing to listen, and who is looking to avoid paying paying $50+ for an SSL certificate, about them and encourage everyone to look into their service.</description>

      <description>We use Octopus Deploy at my workplace to handle all of our releases. The tool is one of the best I&amp;rsquo;ve had the pleasure of dealing with, and the more I interact with it, the more I realize just how powerful, yet flexible, it is. I will gladly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a way of releasing any kind of software.
However, there is always room for improvement.</description>
