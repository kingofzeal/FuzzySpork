      <description>We use Octopus Deploy at my workplace to handle all of our releases. The tool is one of the best I&amp;rsquo;ve had the pleasure of dealing with, and the more I interact with it, the more I realize just how powerful, yet flexible, it is. I will gladly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a way of releasing any kind of software.
However, there is always room for improvement.</description>

      <description>Ever since I started programming, I&amp;rsquo;ve been fascinated with what you can do with a codebase - not just the act of programming, but building and deploying it as well. For a programming company, the less time programmers have to work on building or deploying their code, the more productive they can be. The automation of these things can have a huge benefit.I&amp;rsquo;m sure many who may be reading this already have something in place to automatically build code, either on check-in, at a specific time, or both.</description>
